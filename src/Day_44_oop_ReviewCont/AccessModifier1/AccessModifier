There are four access modifier in java
 - public
 - default
 - protected
 - private
  * variables,constructor and methods are they can take access modifier.

  ** public **
  the access level is everywhere.
  what does it mean everywhere ?
   - current class- outside the current class within package- outsize package.

   ** default **
   The access level is only within package
   if we do not type any access modifier, it will be default.

   ** protected **
  if there is not any relation between class, protected access modifier is like default.
  but there is parent- child relation between class,
  child class can reach parent class, even if it is outside the package(for data memner and methods)

  ** private **
   The access leven is only within class.
   it cannot reach from outside the class.

  ** private constroctur role **
   you connot create the instance out of class.

   **method overloading**
   not be more restrictive overriding method in child class

  ** local veriables**
  dont have access modifier
